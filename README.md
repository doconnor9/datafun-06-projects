# Diandra O'Connor Module 6 Data Analysis Project 2/15/23





## diamonda_exercise.ipynb
This is a guided exploratory data analysis project 

Example from "Intro To Python" by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel, Copyright 2020

Project focuses on diamonds.csv and is based on exercise 9.16

Follow the instructions for Exercise 9.16 (starting pg. 350).
Complete the exercise in a notebook. 
1-Load: Get the file, store it in your repo, and load it into a DataFrame. 
2-View: Display the first 7 rows and the last 7 rows.
3-Describe: Use the DataFrame describe() function to calculate basic descriptive statistics for all numeric columns. 
4-Series: Use the Series method describe() to calculate the descriptive stats for all category/text columns.
4-Unique: Use the Series method unique() to get unique category values. 
5-Histograms: Use the DataFrame's hist() function to create a histogram for each numerical column.
Required: Use Section headings in your Markdown to make it clear that each of these sections are shown in your notebook. They should be numbered 1-5 and include the keyword shown above.
Required: Include the title of the notebook, and your name and date at the top.
Do these consistently. A heading and section titles is required in every notebook.
